*** Spell It ****
*****************

A simple learning game for children around the school starting age. It's goal is to teach them to spell 5 different words. 

1. Install and run the app.

2. When first run, the user is confronted with an image (majority of screen), with 3 spaces above the image. The first of those spaces is marked with a ?. At the bottom of the page (or left hand side if in landscape mode) are three buttons with letters. 

3. If the correct letter button is pushed, the ? turns into the correct lettter. The ? mark moves to the next available space, and the buttons are changed to represent a new set of numbers. When the image has been correctly spelled, the word appears in the centre of the screen. And the game awaits the user to touch the image. Touching the image, will move the game onto the next learning word. 

4. Incorrect attempts will cause a toast alert to fire. 

5. There are only five image words at this time, and the game will cycle betwen them.
